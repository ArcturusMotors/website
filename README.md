## Current design concept is "arcturus.png"

This is a website I'm making to showcase my projects and skills. It's a work in progress, but I'm hoping to have it up and running soon.

It is a **Personal Portfolio** website, and it is being built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It is hopefully going to be completely designed and coded by me, but if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know, or merge a change.
